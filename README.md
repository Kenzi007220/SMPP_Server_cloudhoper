# SMPP_Server_cloudhoper
This project is an important part of the production system of my office. 
For each client (server) that accesses the server, a separate process is 
created and passes the full phase of the sample test messages for the 
SMPP protocol and the response is returned. To develop this, 
it was necessary to study the documentation for SMPP (3.3, 3.4, 5.0)
